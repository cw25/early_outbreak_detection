								<h2>International Response</h2>
								<p>
								Sadly, international response to this deadly outbreak
								was slow. The CDC issued their highest alert on August 7.
								The WHO and UN declared health emergencies on August 8.
								In the span of <font color="orange">22 weeks</font> between
								the original Ebola announcement and the declaration of
								emergency, more than <font color="orange">900 lives</font>
								had been lost. By the end of the outbreak, more than 11000
								people had died.

								<h2>Our Project</h2>
								<p>
								Our <font color="orange">outbreak identification and monitoring</font> system brings together <font color="orange">multiple
								global data sources</font> to identify and track disease-related activities
								around the world. The goal is to provide a <font color="orange">rapid identification system</font>
								through daily monitoring and analysis of web-based news media and social
								media sources. Users can access a <font color="orange">dashboard of current events</font> and quickly view
								all of them or <font color="orange">explore individual events in more detail</font>.

								<h2>Method</h2>
								<p>
								<font color="orange">Machine learning models</font> are used to determine the probability that an
								individual news item is relevant to the subject matter. Then,
								<font color="orange">statistical process control</font> algorithms are employed to identify when there
								has been a significant change in the number or volume of new
								items. The results are displayed graphically, and the source
								data can be accessed through links to the original URLs for further
								validation.

								<h2>GDELT Data</h2>
								<p>
								<a href="http://www.gdeltproject.org/">Google's GDELT Project</a> monitors <font color="orange">broadcast, print, and web news</font>
								from nearly every country on the globe and in over 100 languages.
								Their processes identify the <font color="orange">people, locations, organizations,
								and events</font> that are being written about and discussed. We in
								turn search through the daily GDELT data files in search of
								articles that are of specific interest, running them through
								our data model to see how likely they are to be an important
								contribution to a new or developing event.

								<h2>Twitter Data</h2>
								<p>
								This ubiquitous and familiar <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">microblogging application</a> has
								the potential to be a rich source of notices on breaking
								news and events, yet the signal-to-noise ratio can be overwhelming.
								We have taken an approach of applying a <font color="orange">whitelist of known
								Twitter users</font> who are active participants in global <font color="orange">humanitarian
								and health activities</font>. This narrows the range of communications
								to search through while also increasing the value of those
								communications. Future iterations of this system will gradually
								expand the whitelist based on analyses of the quality of
								information being received.

								<h2>WHO Data</h2>
								<p>
								The <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/ebola-situation-reports">World Health Organization makes available detailed information</a>
								on <font color="orange">public health events around the world</font>. The
								information is published on a weekly basis and relies on <font color="orange">official
								reports from government entities</font>. These aspects make it less
								useful for dynamic early identification of events, however it
								does provide a timely source of information regarding the <font color="orange">human
								impact</font> of such events. We have used their information regarding
								the ebola outbreaks in Africa to augment our other data sources
								with information regarding the <font color="orange">mortality and morbidity</font> of the
								disease.

								<h2>The Result</h2>

								Ultimately, we analyzed

								<font color="orange">160000 tweets</font>
								written between January 1 2014 and November 25 2015 for signs of
								disease outbreaks. We generated nearly <font color="orange">2 years worth

									<p>
									Manufacturers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart">Shewhart charts</a> to 
									detect abnormalities in otherwise reliable processes. We use them to <font color="orange">generate alerts</font>
									when the number of <font color="orange">outbreak-predictive articles or tweets
									is unusually high</font> (more then 3 standard deviations above the previous 30-day
									average). They also generate warnings when the number of daily articles
									relevant to a given disease is above average for 6 days in a row.

								<li class="icon fa-search">
