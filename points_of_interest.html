                    Guinea has just announced that the mystery hemmorhagic fever that has taken 59 lives
                    is indeed Ebola. The Shewhart chart for the day shows an enormous spike, and the map
                    plot clearly shows the concentration of media activity around western Africa.

                    Note the high confidence in the news articles that detail the spread of the
                    virus in the Middle East. In early May, the CDC would confirm the first two
                    cases to arrive in the USA, both in travelers who had visited Saudi Arabia.

                    What would you do? If you were an American NGO analyst, would you send
                    your volunteers to Africa at greater cost to fight a deadlier disease, or
                    would you mobilize them at home in the USA to help fight the flu since it
                    is more contagious? Which disease does the classifier demonstrate higher
                    confidence in as a potential outbreak?

                    The full-blown outbreak is under way. The WHO declared a public health
                    emergency 8 days later. At this point, the death toll was 729. More
                    than 10000 people would die during the year to follow.

                    Not all outbreaks are wide-spread and fatal. The mumps outbreak that began on
                    a University of Illinois campus ultimately grew to more than 80 confirmed
                    cases. Mumps is highly contagious, especially when people live in close quarters
                    such as dorm rooms.
