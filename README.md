# Early Outbreak Detection

This project was the work of myself, David Rose, and Mark Wei Shi. It was submitted as our final capstone project for the
UC Berkeley MIDS program in Fall 2015. This project is a proof-of-concept and should not be considered production-quality.

Our goal was to use data science techniques to build an MVP that could help to shorten response time to outbreaks by aid agencies.

We first built a machine learning model to identify news articles that were indicative of early-stage disease outbreaks.
Then, we used statistical process control techniques to monitor the volume of such articles each day. We plotted daily
trends and generated visual alerts on days when an unusually high number of outbreak indicators were seen.
